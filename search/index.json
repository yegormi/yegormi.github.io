[{"content":"Introduction In our interconnected society Wi Fi networks are everywhere offering easy internet access at home, workplaces and public areas. Yet many people don\u0026rsquo;t realize the security risks that come with it easily exploitable, with tools. This piece dives into a Wi Fi vulnerability testing procedure to show how vulnerable most networks are emphasizing the importance of beefed up security measures.\nSetting up the environment Before delving into examining Wi Fi vulnerabilities in detail it is important to create a testing environment for penetration tests. Utilizing a machine (VM ) is the recommended and most secure approach for deploying Kali Linux, a widely used distribution, for penetration testing purposes.\n1. Installation of Kali Linux Download the latest VM image from the official download page, which is compatible with your virtualization software: Kali Linux website. The Kali Linux already provides pre-made VM images for:\nVMware VirtualBox Select the appropriate one for your virtualization platform.\n2. Software installation If not yet installed, download and install one of the following virtualization softwares:\nVMware Workstation Player (Free for personal use) Oracle VM VirtualBox (Free to use and open-source) 3. Setting up the VM For VMware Users Import the VM Image: Run VMware Workstation Player. Choose the downloaded file in Open under File. Follow everything on the screen to import the VM. Configure VM Settings (Optional): Customize memory and CPU options according to your system\u0026rsquo;s capabilities. Make sure that the network adapter corresponds to your needs either Bridged or NAT. For VirtualBox Users Import the VM Image:\nOpen VirtualBox. Choose File then Import to choose the .ova file you have downloaded. Complete the instructions to add the VM. Configure VM Settings (Optional):\nRight-click on the Kali VM and select Settings. Tweak System settings regarding memory and processors. Make sure that the network adapter corresponds to your needs either Bridged or NAT. 4. Kali Linux Installation Once the VM is set up, you need to go through the installation process of Kali Linux. To do this,\nPower on the VM by selecting it and hitting the Start button.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see the Kali Linux boot menu. Choose \u0026ldquo;Graphical Install\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo;, whichever your preference is.\nProceed with the installation by going through each step in TUI:\nSelect Language, Location and Keyboard layout. Configure the network: usually this is set for default Configure users and password: remember to insert a good password Partition disk: usually you can select Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM Install base system and additional packages. Once the installation is complete, the system will ask you to reboot it.\n5. Launching Kali Linux When the machine reboots, you will be greeted by the Kali Linux login screen. Log in with your username and password given during installation. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t changed the default credentials during installation, then these will be:\nUsername: kali Password: kali You are strongly advised to alter this default password during first usage of Kali Linux:\n1 passwd 6. Updating Kali Linux Ensure your Kali Linux instance is up to date:\n1 sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt full-upgrade -y 7. Configuring external Wi-Fi adapter For effective wireless penetration testing, an external Wi-Fi adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection is necessary.\nConnect the Wi-Fi Adapter:\nPlug the adapter into your computer. I will be using the USB-C to USB-A to use one of my Wi-Fi adapters is based on Ralink RT5370 Attach the Adapter to the VM:\nFor VMware:\nEvery time any USB gets connected you will get a pop-up saying whether you want to leave with Parent PC or pass it down to VM OR\nGo to Virtual Machine \u0026gt; USB \u0026gt; Connect \u0026ldquo;Name of you device\u0026rdquo;. For VirtualBox:\nGo to Devices \u0026gt; USB \u0026gt; Select your Wi-Fi adapter. Verify the Adapter in Kali:\n1 iwconfig 8. Testing the Setup Confirm that your Wi-Fi adapter can enter monitor mode:\n1 sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 Once the Kali Linux VM is established we can go straight to penetration testing and get around the issue listed above\nUnderstanding Wi-Fi vulnerabilities Older security protocols in Wi-Fi networks make them vulnerable to diverse attacks. Hackers can steal the data and enter areas they are not allowed to reach. The steps involved in a conventional Wi-Fi penetration testing scenario will be explained in this analysis to reveal these vulnerabilities.\n⚠️ IMPORTANT ETHICAL AND LEGAL NOTICE ⚠️\nIt is important to point out that such password cracking should be carried out on networks one owns or is explicitly authorized to do some testing of. Cracking passwords on other people\u0026rsquo;s networks is considered illegal and totally unethical.\nWi-Fi penetration testing process 1. Checking network interfaces Begin by collecting information regarding your system interfaces and networks first.\n1 2 3 # See version of Kali Linux cat /etc/os-release uname -a 1 2 3 # List network interfaces ip addr iwconfig As we can already see the name from wlan0 has been changed to wlan0mon indicating that the adapter is in monitor mode right now\nThe tools for performing penetration tests are included in Kali Linux from the start.\n2. Killing conflicting processes 1 sudo airmon-ng check kill Turning off network related services solves problems related to setting up monitor mode needed for packet capture.\n3. Enabling Monitor Mode 1 sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 Switch the wireless interface to monitor mode, if it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen in previous steps to start captureing traffic.\n1 2 3 # Verify monitor mode sudo airmon-ng iwconfig 4. Scanning for Access Points Search for nearby Wi-Fi access points to find our final target.\n1 sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon The tool airodump-ng shares complete information regarding accessible networks including channels and BSSIDs.\n5. Capturing Handshake Data 1 2 # Start capturing packets on the target network sudo airodump-ng -w dump -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] wlan0mon Replace [channel] and [BSSID] with the information of your target network. The handshake occurs when any device connects to your network. Capturing this is your chance to try and test the password of the network offline.\n6. Launch a deauthentication attack Force devices to reconnect to the network, thereby increasing the probability of capturing handshake data.\nCreate another window of Terminal application and place it to the side of already running command done by the previous step\n1 sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [BSSID] wlan0mon Replace BSSID by your own. Deauthentication attacks prevent users from using the connections by making all connected devices re-authenticate so that the process can be intercepted.\nSo now we can procceed to step 7 to precisely look for EAPOL handshake and extract it to pass less data to converter or just skip it, as we already know the dump already contains needed data\n7. Captured data analysis using Wireshark (optional) Look for captured packets and confirm that a successful handshake was captured.\n1 wireshark dump-01.cap EAPOL is a part of the Wireshark filter which makes it easy to find the relevant authentication packets. You should have seen this keyword on the previous step, indicating that someone has connected to network. We can extract only EAPOL handshakes to make the file size smaller or convert(next step) the file without modifying it, which works in mostly every way, if you don\u0026rsquo;t do long scans (\u0026gt; 5 mins)\n8. Convert captured file into a format for our next tool Using the official converter provided by the Hashcat team, the capture file needs to be converted into a suitable format. Online tool can be used from here or using the CLI\nMake sure you restart NetworkManager to gain Internet access back, otherwise you will not be able to download the package\n1 sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager If you want to use CLI tool over a simple website, then you have to install hcxtools package which contains mostly everything from Hashcat team.\n1 2 sudo apt install hcxtools hcxpcapngtool -o dump.hc22000 dump-01.cap After execution you should see something like that\n9. Decoding captured file\u0026rsquo;s hash to real password Finally, let\u0026rsquo;s do a password strength test using Hashcat. I will be testing this on my Macbook Pro 16 2021 with M1 Pro GPU and i7-8700 + RX 6600 XT using macOS Sonoma (Hackintosh)\n1 hashcat -m 22000 dump.hc22000 -a 3 \u0026#34;?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d\u0026#34; where:\n-m 22000 specifies the WPA-PBKDF2-PMKID+EAPOL algorithm. -a 3 indicates a mask attack. \u0026quot;?d\u0026quot; represents a digit. Time to crack the hash GPU Cracking Time (8-digit numerical password) AMD RX 6600 XT ~5 minutes NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti ~10 minutes Apple M1 Pro GPU ~12 minutes Apple M1 GPU ~40 minutes In order to test the strength of Wi-Fi passwords, many users rely on simple or default passwords such as 8-digit numerical combinations. Added to the defaults above, many users use their phone numbers as Wi-Fi passwords, and these in turn also follow predictable formats, especially within certain regions.\nFor instance, a Ukrainian phone number like 0661234567, 0951234567 is of a pattern already known and can be used to shrink the number of iterations during a password strength test\n10. Accessing network If the password is determined in no time, that is a clear indication of bad security. This information is valuable for the utilization of strong, complicated passwords to secure Wi-Fi networks.\nImplications and why most Wi-Fi networks are insecure Weak passwords Too many users assign simple, easily guessed passwords. The use of default or common passwords makes brute-force attacks successful.\nUse of outdated security protocols Those networks which still make use of WEP or which have WPA/WPA2 but are poorly configured remain highly susceptible to attacks. Even WPA2 may become compromised provided it is not installed correctly.\nLack of user awareness Users often are uninformed regarding Wi-Fi security and hence never change default settings. Typical person would install the router and never touch it again until it breaks. They don\u0026rsquo;t use intergrated web interface to see who is connected to network, which is a quite handy feature.\nAvailability of Testing Tools All of the tools utilized in this tutorial are free to download and very accessible. This means that the threshold to test network security is low, but potential abuse because of that fact is much greater.\nSecuring Your Wi-Fi Network Use Strong, Complex Passwords Passwords should be long and consist of a range of letter, numeric, and special characters.\nImprove Security Settings Use WPA3 if it\u0026rsquo;s an option. Do not use anything less than WPS2 with AES encryption enabled.\nDisable WPS WPS can be an active vulnerability in security. We can cover this in another article, where we could discuss WPS as a potential exploit. Disabling this feature removes another vector for attack.\nIf you have a TP-LINK router, you can do this: Go to the router\u0026rsquo;s admin panel (typically 192.168.0.1)\nLog in with your credentials Click on the Advanced tab Tap Wireless and select WPS from the menu Turn that setting off Router Firmware Update Vendors publish updates to fix vulnerabilities. Keeping the firmware updated improves security.\nMonitor Connected Devices Periodically look and see what devices are connected to your network to find unauthorized access.\nPhishing Independent from the above technical weaknesses, phishing remains probably one of the most persistent and effective attack methods. Phishing does not exploit directly the Wi-Fi protocols but instead targets the user to steal sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data. No matter how much network security advances, phishing attacks will always be an issue since they rely on human trust and error. This is the reason why user awareness against phishing is as crucial as any technical defense. In the long term, teaching users how to recognize phishing attempts may turn out to be the most important strategy for securing Wi-Fi networks.\nConclusion The fact that a Wi-Fi network can be cracked and accessed so easily using tools that are widely available shows a severe security gap. In fact, through understanding these vulnerabilities, users would be aware of the steps they must take to secure their networks: from strong passwords to updated protocols and the like to increased vigilance against unauthorized access.\nReferences Kali Linux Official Documentation Aircrack-ng Documentation Hashcat Wiki Wireshark User Guide ","date":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://yegormi.github.io/post/why-most-wi-fi-networks-are-insecure/header_hu16518706301154349171.jpg","permalink":"https://yegormi.github.io/post/why-most-wi-fi-networks-are-insecure/","title":"Why most Wi-Fi networks are insecure"}]
